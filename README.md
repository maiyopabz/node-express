# node-express

I learned to use the Express framework to implement a web server.
I also installed the Morgan middleware library to log server requests, and I used Express's built-in express.
Static middleware to serve static HTML files.

I used the Express framework and Express router to build a server supporting a REST API.

I demonstrate my understanding of creating Node modules and implementing the Express router to 
route HTTP requests to different sets of endpoints, and respond to them.
